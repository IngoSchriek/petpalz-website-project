## The Creation Process
With this project, I wanted to make it big and challenge myself, so I thought that making an e-commerce website would give me a great experience and an opportunity to use my knowledge in practice. I started having some troubles, the bigger problem for me doing this project was finding and creating images, but  along the project I was getting better and  also improving a lot my tech skills. At this time I knew just the very basic of JavaScript, but with some searching I could figure out how to make dynamic changes on the page using it. The search system and the filter system was fun to create, and the parts that required me most of problem solving were my favorite parts. At the end of the project I got a lot of confidence to build projects even better. I hope you enjoy it!
